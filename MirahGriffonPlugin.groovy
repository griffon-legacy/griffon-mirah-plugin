    String description = '''
The Mirah plugin enables compiling and running [Mirah]][1] code on your Griffon application.

Usage
-----
You must place all Mirah code under `$appdir/src/mirah`, it will be compiled first before any sources available on 
`griffon-app` or `src/main` which means you can't reference any of those sources from your Mirah code, while the
Groovy sources can.
